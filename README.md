# Instagram_Like_Bot

Project Name: Instagram Automation Selenium Project

Description:

This Selenium project automates the process of logging into Instagram, visiting a designated user's profile, and automatically liking their posts. It also includes the option to undo all likes if desired.

The project consists of the following key steps:

Instagram Login: Selenium automatically logs into Instagram using the user-provided login credentials, granting access to the user's account.

Profile Visit: Users direct the automation to visit the profile of the desired Instagram user. Selenium visits the profile and begins reviewing its content.

Post Liking: Selenium scans and opens each post on the visited profile, liking them one by one. This process continues until all posts have received automatic likes.

Undoing Likes (Optional): After liking all posts, the project can optionally undo all likes, based on the user's preference. This provides the option to retract previously given likes.

This project enables users to automatically explore and like the content on a specific Instagram profile, streamlining the process and saving time.

Note: This project may potentially violate Instagram's terms of service, leading to account suspension. Careful review of Instagram's policies is essential before using the project. Additionally, respecting privacy and permissions when liking others' content without consent is crucial.
